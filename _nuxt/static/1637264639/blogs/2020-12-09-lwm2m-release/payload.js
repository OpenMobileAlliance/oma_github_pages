With the introduction of MQTT and HTTP support, the developer community, who has expressed strong interest in them, will be able to select the truly best option for each deployment environment. Also being introduced in v1.2, support for gateways allows deployment managers to connect islands of IoT devices while maintaining all capabilities offered with LwM2M.

The original standard was a compelling solution for device lifecycle management with focus on constrained IoT devices. With LwM2M adoption observed across a broader range of device types and the benefit of feedback from real use cases, releases including v1.0.1 and v1.0.2 were published to keep up with ever increasing demand and expansion of LwM2M use. With v1.1 published in 2018, OMA SpecWorks increased the functionality of the protocol by adding support for Cellular IoT, LoRaWAN as well as in enterprise networks with CoAP over TCP\u002FTLS.",".md")));
