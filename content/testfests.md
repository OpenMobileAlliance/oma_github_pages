## Previous TestFest

Over the years, OMA has organized several LwM2M TestFest and Workshop Events. A full list of Events can be seen <a href="(https://guidelines.openmobilealliance.org/testfests)" target="_blank">here</a>

## TestFest Frequent Asked Questions

This section aims to provide an overview of what is an OMA TestFest Event, and what you can expect out of the Event.

#### What is an OMA SpecWorks TestFest?

OMA TestFests are designed to achieve a number of goals, including:

* Ensuring the quality of OMA specifications
* Enabling vendors to verify and test the interoperability of their product implementations in a multi-vendor environment
* Provide a peer-to-peer networking environment for participants

TestFests are held in a confidential and secure testing environment where companies can bring their Client or Server implementation(s) based on an OMA Enabler to test in multiple multi-vendor combinations. These events are open to both OMA member and non-member companies.

#### When is the next TestFest?

See at the top of this web page.

There are 1 to 2 TestFest events held per year. These events are hosted in a variety of locations and venues throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. Registration fees are per implementation (engineers are free to attend) and vary based on the expenses estimated to cover the event. If you are interested in hosting a TestFest at your companyâ€™s facility, please contact our <a href="https://omaspecworks.org/contact-us/" target="_blank">staff</a>.

#### Prerequisites for a TestFest

TestFests are open to the public, as long as you fulfill the following criteria for entry to the event:

* You have a unique implementation of an OMA Enabler, developed by the company or in direct association with a third party
* You have implemented all mandatory features of the Enabler to be tested
* You have passed any entry conformance or other preparatory tests defined for the event, listed in the appendix section of the Enabler Test Specifications: `Entry Criteria for a TestFest`
* You have signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), provided by OMA, prior to attending the TestFest

#### Registering for a TestFest

The registration link for each event will be included with the TestEvent date and location on this TestFest homepage. During registration, you will be asked to select which OMA SpecWorks Enabler you will be testing and if you are a Client or Server. The specified fee for that event will be due upon registering and the event information will inform you what the fee covers / includes for the event.

Once registration closes, OMA SpecWorks staff will create a formal testing agenda that will be distributed to participants on-site. More detailed travel and event information, including recommendations on where to stay, a general overview of the schedule, arriving at the TestFest, and what to expect on-site, will be distributed via email to all participants as registration is in progress and once registration closes.

Participating teams may download the test material to be used during the event under each Enabler.

#### Reporting Test Session Results

When on-site, the Client teams will be required to complete a Test Session Report for each test session, verified by the Server team. These reports record the results that apply to all of the test cases that are part of the Enabler Test Specification defined by the members. Each report is confidential to the companies participating in that session.

At the end of the TestFest, OMA SpecWorks publicly posts the results of the event on the <a href="https://guidelines.openmobilealliance.org/testfests" target="_blank">TestFest Events</a> page via a <a href="https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/dmse-documentation/tree/master/content/en" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>. In the table you will see:
* Who is the Event host, _(if you are interesting in hosting an event please contact the <a href="https://omaspecworks.org/contact-us/" target="_blank">staff</a>_
* Physical location of the Event,
* Date of the Event,
* Consolidated test results for all the participants, _available for download in PDF_, and
* Individual results per company, implementation and version. _See Product Listing_ below.

 The consolidated report provides an indication to the OMA Working Group of both, the completeness of the Specification as well as the quality of the implementations that are being tested. Based on the consolidated results from more than one TestFest Event, the Working Group may decide to formally Approved the Technical Specifications.

Lastly, OMA SpecWorks hosts a <a href="https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/wiki/Product-Listing" target="_blank">Product Listing</a> page in a <a href="https://guidelines.openmobilealliance.org/listing" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> where companies have the opportunity to market the implementation that has been tested. 

#### Reporting Issues with the Specification

One of the important aspects of any interoperability testing session is to record and process the issues found during the TestFest Event. This will allow the corresponding Working Groups to determine how the issue should be resolved, TestFest participants may have the opportunity to raise their queries directly with the corresponding Technical Working Group.

For LWM2M Test events, participants are asked to submit any issues they encounter with the specification on the OMA GitHub <a href="https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues" target="_blank">Issues - LwM2M for Developers</a>. This repository  is monitored by the <a href="https://lwm2m.openmobilealliance.org/about/" target="_blank">Device Management Working Group</a> and the <a href="https://lwm2m.openmobilealliance.org/about/" target="_blank">IPSO Working Group</a>.
