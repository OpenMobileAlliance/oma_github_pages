They ensure the quality of OMA specifications, allow vendors to verify and test the interoperability of their product implementations in a multi-vendor environment, and provide a peer-to-peer networking environment for participants. These events are held in a confidential and secure testing environment, welcoming both OMA members and non-member companies.
