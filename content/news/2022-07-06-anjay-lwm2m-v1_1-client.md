The original proposal for LwM2M, a new standardized communication protocol for IoT device lifecycle management dates back to 2012. It took until 2017 to have the specification of LwM2M version 1.0 finalized. This was followed by releases of updated versions of the protocol v1.0.1 and v1.0.2, which incorporated feedback from early standard adopters and their real-life use cases. This work resulted in a couple of existing and well-maintained open source projects including our [Anjay](https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay), Eclipse’s [Wakamaa](https://github.com/eclipse/wakaama) & [Leshan](https://github.com/eclipse/leshan) and [IOWA](https://github.com/IOTEROP/IOWA).

Release of v1.1 in 2018 brought a bunch of new features including support for Cellular IoT, LoRaWAN and enterprise networks with CoAP over TCP. The other significant improvements came from features improving overall device energy-efficiency, mobility and security capabilities. These are among others DTLS Connection ID, various efficient data encoding formats and asynchronous data sending capabilities. These features prove to be quite relevant for many growing IoT verticals in which LwM2M fits well (e.g., smart metering, asset tracking). However, until now there have been no freely available implementations of LwM2M v1.1, which significantly hampered adoption of LwM2M in the aforementioned verticals. This is especially true for developers and technology enthusiasts that were prevented from easy access to LwM2M v1.1 features to play with them.

AVSystem is proud to announce the release of Anjay 3.0, which opens the LwM2M network stack for free usage regardless of the LwM2M protocol version. By opening a network stack, AVSystem aims to promote LwM2M technology and enable a smooth adoption of LwM2M in a wide-range of IoT verticals.

Anjay 3.0 is available under [BSD-like 5-clause licensing terms](https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay/blob/master/LICENSE). In practice, you’re free to use it for up to 100,000 devices and all you need to do is let AVSystem know about it if you want to use it commercially. For more information, go straight to the [Github repo](https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay) and try it out.
