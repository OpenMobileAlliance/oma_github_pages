We have published a revision of **LwM2M v1.2!**

In December 2020, we published LwM2M v1.2, which included a range of new features.  Since then, we received developer feedback – both from member companies and from the open source community through our Github issue tracker, see [Issues](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues).

As a result of all this feedback, we have clarified the specification text and we are happy to announce the publication of **LwM2M v1.2.1** - the revision of **LwM2M v1.2**.

While there are a long list of clarifications and corrections, none impact the backwards compatibility.  For a developer seeking the latest and greatest specification of LwM2M, version 1.2.1 is the place to go:

- [Core spécification](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_2_1-20221209-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_2_1-20221209-A.html#1-1-0-11-Revision-121)


- [Transport specification](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_2_1-20221209-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Transport-V1_2_1-20221209-A.html)

We look forward to receiving your [feedback](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues) on this new revision of the LwM2M specification.
