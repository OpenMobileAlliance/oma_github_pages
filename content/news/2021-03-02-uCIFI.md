>**The uCIFI Alliance**, see [https://ucifi.org](https://ucifi.org), collaborates with the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) to standardize a unified data model for smart city, energy and water utility companies.

The uCIFI Alliance recently announced the public release of their data model to provide interoperability between the billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices around the world and frees companies from the costly and time–consuming task of bridging a variety of vendor systems and equipment.<!--more-->

Launched in 2018 by several pioneering IoT companies, the uCIFI Alliance has become a joint initiative by market leaders, large cities, energy and water-utility companies to converge on a unified data model that enables a quick, easy and native communication architecture between sensors/actuators and device management systems over any type of communication network. Example communication technologies include 4G/NB-IoT, LoRaWAN, and Wi-SUN wireless mesh.

A series of 29 LwM2M objects – all used for smart-city projects, have been contributed to the Open Mobile Alliance’s  Lightweight Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M) registry. These uCIFI contributed objects and their associated resources are modelled using the LwM2M data format so they can be used on any constrained IoT network. They can also be implemented freely by any vendor in any product so that they can meet cities’ and utilities’ tender requirements for openness and interoperability. The registered objects can be found at [https://openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html](https://openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html) (search for uCIFI) or our GitHub repository [https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry) and work best with the LwM2M device management protocol. 

>The OMA is committed to working with industry alliances and consortia with the goal of promoting open and freely available data model objects.
