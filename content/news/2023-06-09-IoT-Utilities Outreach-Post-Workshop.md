This workshop addresses the needs of the utilities sector as they deploy new functionality through adoption of the LwM2M protocol.

**Why is LightWeight M2M important for Utilities?**

As the developer of the LwM2M protocol, OMA aims to help the industry deploy better and more reliably interoperable implementations of the LwM2M specification.

International climate legislation is driving the need for higher levels of functionality in meters used by the utilities sector for measuring gas, water, and power consumption.  For example, businesses are being driven by legislators, regulators, insurers, and shareholders to begin to account for their Scope 3 emission levels and to incorporate climate risks in their reporting.  There is a new generation of meters in development now that allows for better measurement and control of carbon, water usage, and consumption analysis for residential and commercial applications that is being driven by these regulations.

In nearly every case, the developers and deployers of these meters are interested in or require the use of LightWeightM2M (LwM2M) as the transport and control protocol.  It is OMAâ€™s goal to use its position as the developer of the LwM2M to help the industry deploy better and more reliably interoperable implementations of the LwM2M specification. 

This workshop represents the Utility sector's new functionalities by adopting the LwM2M protocol.q
- Device Management: Explain the importance of device management in addressing security concerns for utilities and how LwM2M can help manage constrained devices like meters, sensors, and dataloggers.
- Introduction to LwM2M: Provide an overview of the LwM2M protocol, its benefits for IoT devices, and how it can be implemented for device management.
- LwM2M Security: Discuss the security features of LwM2M, including device authentication, secure communication, and how they help address security concerns for utilities.
- LwM2M Use Cases: Showcase real-world use cases where LwM2M has been successfully implemented by and for utilities, highlighting the benefits achieved through the protocol's adoption.
- LwM2M Interoperability: Provide a status update on the current state of LwM2M interoperability and call for actions to promote its widespread adoption.
- Open Discussion and Q&A: Facilitate an open discussion among attendees to share insights, ask questions, and engage in discussions related to the previous topics.
