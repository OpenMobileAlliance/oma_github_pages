The Lightweight M2M protocol (LwM2M) has proven itself to be a well suited to operating within Cellular networks. LwM2M is being used with a wide range of Device Types from Low Latency critical IoT applications such as remote performance monitoring to high latency massive IoT application such as water metering. 

Currently, there are multiple approaches for deploying cellular device management but in most cases the devices have to be somehow provisioned to a LwM2M server before use. At a minimum this is the URL location of the LwM2M server, but it often also includes security credentials that are particular to the LwM2M server that it is tied to. Provisioning this information is done within the supply chain and adds cost and complexity to the roll out of device. In its simplest form, it involves using spreadsheets between organisations but for more mature supply chains, manufacturing systems can for example be integrated with LwM2M servers to provide a more seamless and secure approach. 

This work item looks to see how to avoid this supply chain complexity in cellular networks by utilising their inherent trustworthiness. Cellular networks already provide root of trust anchoring to the cellular subscription as well as various levels of encryption on the radio network. Cellular networks also provide a secure domain for which access can be controlled. 

The ultimate goal would be to allow a manufacturer to create devices in an entirely generic way and allow them to automatically attach to any operator defined server depending on which cellular subscription is used.
